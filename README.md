Important: This Repository "Vancouver-Site-Optimization-MASW-analysis" is for generating the experimental fundamental mode dispersion curve from dispersion curve of Vancouver Site and obtaining the theoretical fundamental mode dispersion curve corresponding to the optimized Vs profile. 
         
Please adopt the following steps to run the code.

Guideline for quick test of Site-1 data
Step-1: Open MATLAB file "MASWaves".
Step-2: Inoput the disperison curve using "c_curve0.mat" and "lambda_curve0" of Vancouver Site and use it in "MASWaves.m" file. 
Step-3: Run the "MASWaves.m" code to obtian experimental fundamtal mode. 
Step-4: After click on Run, Maltlab code generate the theoretical dispersion curve corresponding to the optimized Vs profile. 
Step-5: The optimized Vs profile obtained from TLBO algorithm is already given in this "MASWaves" code. Click on Run "MASWaves.m" to generate the theoretical fundamental mode corresponding to optimized Vs profile.

The Optimized Vs profiles obtained at 100th iteration from TLBO are presented in the manuscript to shows the comparison of experimental and theoretical fundamental mode dispersion curves.
